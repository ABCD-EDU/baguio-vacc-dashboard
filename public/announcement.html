                As the city continues to see a spike in COVID-19 cases, Dr. Donnabel Tubera Panes, Medical Officer
                IV, City Health Services Office, appealed to the public to help our already exhausted healthcare
                workers by continuing to follow the Minimum Public Health Standards, getting vaccinated, isolating
                when you have symptoms, and discarding misinformation. - Ariel Biala/PIO Baguio
